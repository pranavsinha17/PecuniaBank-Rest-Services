# PecuniaBank-Rest-Services
Backend for Pecunia Bank


## `Note:` I have created two branches guys.....the master branch is the root of our service application so we will not experiment on the master branch.This branch will only contain bug free code that we will end in the end.
## We have to work with the `integrated-branch` that is created already. Below are some commands that we all need to follow while pulling and pushing the codes.


## After downloading the zip file...do follow these steps

After opening download folder location in command  do `git init`  --to initialize your local repository

`git fetch https://github.com/pranavsinha17/PecuniaBank-Rest-Services.git integrated-branch:integrated-branch` -- it will fetch the data from integrated branch and at the same time it will create a new branch named `integrated-branch` locally

Now you can check by `git branch`

After that do the changes in code and do the commit.

Now do `git checkout integrated-branch` -- you will enter to the `integrated branch` branch locally.

Now do the commands to add your repo to the github.

`git remote add origin https://github.com/pranavsinha17/PecuniaBank-Rest-Services.git`

`git push -u origin integrated-branch`  --NOTE it is not master it is our new branch where we have to push the code. It is very important step..


## I hope we all understood this ....and all the very best all of you...you all are going to rock..kudos.
